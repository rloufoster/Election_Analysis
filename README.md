# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of the recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
2. Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
3. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
